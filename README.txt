Hi! Welcome to the program of 15 puzzle. The way to compile and run this program you need to compile 4 classes:
 Board.java, Game.java, MenuButtons.java and Tuple.java. 
Afterwards you javac Game.java and the game will being.

DISCLAIMER: My BFS is implemented but it is not working as it should be. If you click autosolve 
it will be in an infinite loop, all the code is there its just some small bug. GUI is NOT updated 
to BFS search,mainly due to the fact that it hasn't been implemented fully 100% workingly. Everything 
else should work.
